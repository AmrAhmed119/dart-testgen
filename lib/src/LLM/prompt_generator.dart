Given the following Dart code to test:

```dart
$toBeTestedCode
```

With the following context:

```dart
$contextCode
```

Write a Dart unit test that covers **only** the lines marked with `// UNTESTED`.

- The provided code is **partial**, showing only relevant members (e.g., fields, methods).
- The context code includes required dependencies or references.
- Focus **only** on `// UNTESTED` lines â€” ignore already-tested ones.
- Assume default values or minimal mocks where needed.
- If the provided code is trivial, untestable, or does not require a test, set "needTesting": false and leave "code" empty.
- If any external packages are used in the test (e.g., mockito, http, async, etc.), make sure to import them in the test code.
