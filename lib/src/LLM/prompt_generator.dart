Generate a Dart unit test for the following code:

```dart
$toBeTestedCode
```

With the following context:

```dart
$contextCode
```

Requirements:
- Test ONLY the lines marked with `// UNTESTED` - ignore already tested code.
- The provided code is partial, showing only relevant members.
- Use appropriate mocking for external dependencies.
- If the code is trivial or untestable, set "needTesting": false and leave "code" empty (don't generate any code).
- Skip generating tests for private members (those starting with `_`).
- Primarily use the `test` package for writing tests, avoiding using `mockito` package.
- Use the actual classes and methods from the codebase - import the necessary packages instead of creating mock or temporary classes.
- Import any other required Dart packages (e.g., `async`, `test`, etc.) as needed.
- Follow Dart testing best practices with descriptive test names.

Return the complete test file with proper imports and test structure.
