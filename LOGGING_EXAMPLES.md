# Enhanced Logging in TestGen Workflow

This document demonstrates the logging enhancements implemented in the test generation workflow.

## Logging Categories

The test generation process now includes structured logging with clear prefixes for different components:

### 1. TestGen Main Process (`[testgen]`)
- Progress tracking for test generation
- Completion status and token usage

Example output:
```
[testgen] Generating tests for MyClass, remaining: 5
[testgen] Test generation ended with created and used 1247 tokens.
```

### 2. LLM Operations (`[LLM]`)
- Test file creation status
- Rate limiting and retry logic
- Error handling

Example output:
```
[LLM] No significant logic to test in simple_getter_test.dart. Skipping.
[LLM] Rate limit exceeded, retrying in 2 seconds...
[LLM] Error encountered
```

### 3. Validation (`[Validator]`)
- Test validation failures
- Coverage validation results

Example output:
```
[Validator] Check failed.
```

### 4. Coverage Collection (`[Coverage]`)
- Test execution and coverage collection status
- Coverage analysis results

Example output:
```
[Coverage] Running tests and collecting coverage...
[Coverage] Baseline uncovered lines: 15
[Coverage] Current uncovered lines: 8
[Coverage] Coverage improved: true
```

## Benefits

- **Better debugging**: Clear component identification makes it easier to trace issues
- **Progress tracking**: Users can see exactly what stage the process is in
- **Performance monitoring**: Token usage and timing information helps optimize LLM calls
- **Error context**: Component-specific logging helps identify where problems occur
